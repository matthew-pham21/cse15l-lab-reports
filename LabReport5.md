## **In this lab report, we are required to create a debugging scenario, which involves constructing an error-inducing function and bug, utilizing at least one bash script and one java script. We also create a conversation involving edStem, and making a post, while we have to respond as a TA with a leading question or a command. We must detail out every step of this process. Here is the conversation:

## **1) EdStem Post and Response**
Student:
```Hello, I'm currently experiencing issues with my code, which is to add together integer lists using a **merge** method, into one larger list, where we compare two indexed integers, and add the greater number to the new list first, then add the other integers in later. However, I keep running into the following bugs, and can't decipher how to fix them. Any advice would be helpful! I've included a screenshot below to showcase the bugs.```
