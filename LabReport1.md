# For this lab report, we were required to test nine different cases between three commands: *cd* (change directory) , *ls* (list), and *cat* (concatenate). Here are the following results:

**1. cd (change directory)**

For this command, it required us to perform the cd line command in a terminal in our edstem workspace environment, without any parameters or arguments attached, and our working directory at the time was /home, as we had not done any modifications or changes to directory at that point. After using the cd command without any arguments, nothing happened, as demonstrated by the lack of change in the directory (still ~ without anything following, which indicated that no change in directory occurred, and that we are still within the /home working directory), which is because without an argument (in the form of a directory such as /messages), there is no directory to change to, and as such, we stay in the same directory.
